# FOR POP UP TOPICS

# To upload file in the browser , check in path there should be type = file , in most of the cases there are file type.
#But if there is not file type we can not upload file in the browser.
#There are three types of pop ups
#1. Alerts -- javaScript pop up -- Alert API ( accept , dismiss)
#2. File upload pop up -- browser button ( type = file , sendleys(path of the file)
#3. Browser window popup -- Advertisement pop up ( windowHandler API - getWindowHandler() )
#4.we have one topic called Synchronization -- whic has Implicitwaits, ExplicitWaits, FluentWaits.
#5.If we wants to play vidio , we can not do with selenium , we have to use sikulli for that.
